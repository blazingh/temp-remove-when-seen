    <h2 className="border-l-4 border-solid border-gray-400 pl-2 font-medium text-xl mt-5 mb-3">3. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES</h2>
    
    <p className="mb-2 text-md"><b>3.1.</b> The Platform has been established by Diştedavim to facilitate digital communication between Users. Diştedavim does not conduct intermediary or advertising activities for any Clinic accessing the Platform, but only provides the necessary technical infrastructure for communication between Users. Any element on the Platform or any announcement, notification, correspondence, or similar information provided by Diştedavim under this Agreement cannot be interpreted as directing Users to a specific Clinic, recommending a specific Clinic Service, or providing or arranging online dental services. The relationships to be established between Users via the Platform are entirely at the discretion of the Users, and Diştedavim does not provide any recommendation or guidance in this regard.</p>
    
    <p className="mb-2 text-md"><b>3.2.</b> Users may benefit from the Services without registering as a member, or they may also become members by clicking on the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button on the Platform and filling out the required information on the screen that opens. To become a member, the User must share their personal information and set a password. Membership is completed by entering the code from the SMS sent to the User&apos;s phone into the application form and by approving the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Personal Data Text, and other approval buttons by the User electronically.</p>
    
    <p className="mb-2 text-md"><b>3.3.</b> Clinics publish information such as Clinic name and address, offered Clinic Services, and resident dentists by registering them on the Platform for access by other Users. Individual Users can view Clinics by filtering by time and place using the search engine on the Platform and access the information published by Clinics under this provision. Individual Users can contact the Clinic through the Platform to make an appointment for receiving Clinic Services they find suitable after the search results. Diştedavim does not have the discretion to determine the scope and conditions of Clinic Services, appointment dates and times, appointment and treatment fees, and only provides technical support for Clinics to publish this information and for Individual Users to contact Clinics at their discretion by viewing this information.</p>
    
    <p className="mb-2 text-md"><b>3.4.</b> An Individual User can have online consultations with dentists working at the Clinic selected through the Platform. Online consultations with the Clinic are only advisory and do not constitute diagnosis, examination, or treatment. Diştedavim has no direct or indirect liability for any diagnosis, examination, or treatment nature of online consultations. Furthermore, Diştedavim has no obligation or ability to monitor the content of the online consultation or intervene in the activities of Clinics. Diştedavim reserves the right of recourse in this regard.</p>
    
    <p className="mb-2 text-md"><b>3.5.</b> The online consultation between the Clinic and the Individual User will be conducted through online platforms providing video conferencing capabilities.

Therefore, Individual Users or Clinics cannot apply to Diştedavim alleging that the other party did not fulfill their obligations or acted contrary to the legislation or the contract between them. For the same reason, Diştedavim does not inspect, control, or guarantee Clinic Services, and does not intervene in them.</p>
